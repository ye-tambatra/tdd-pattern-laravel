## What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a cycle of "red, green, refactor":

-   Red: Write a failing test case that describes the desired behavior.
-   Green: Write the simplest code to make the test pass.
-   Refactor: Improve the code without changing its behavior while keeping all tests passing.

## Why TDD?

-   Faster Debugging: Catching and fixing bugs early in the development process saves time and effort.
-   Confidence in Changes: Having a comprehensive suite of tests gives confidence when making changes or refactoring code.
-   Improved Code Quality: TDD encourages writing clean, modular, and testable code.
-   Design Guidance: TDD helps in designing interfaces and APIs based on usage requirements.
